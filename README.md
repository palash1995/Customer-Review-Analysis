# British Airways Review Analysis

This repository is dedicated to the analysis of British Airways customer reviews. We have developed a web scraping script using Beautiful Soup to collect data from review websites. The collected data is then processed, visualized, and subjected to sentiment analysis using transformer-based models. This project aims to provide insights into the sentiment and opinions of customers towards British Airways.

## Web Scraping

We used the Beautiful Soup library to scrape customer reviews and related information from online review websites. The web scraping script collects reviews, ratings, dates, and other relevant data, which are stored for further analysis.

## Data Preprocessing

The collected data often requires cleaning and preprocessing. This includes handling missing values, text cleaning (removing special characters, HTML tags, etc.), and structuring the data for analysis. The preprocessed data is then ready for exploration and analysis.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization is an essential step in understanding the collected data. We create various visualizations, such as bar charts, word clouds, and histograms, to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from the reviews. Visualization helps in summarizing the data and identifying potential areas of interest.

## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is performed on the customer reviews to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed by the customers. We utilize transformer-based models for sentiment analysis. These models are well-suited for understanding the context and nuances of natural language.
